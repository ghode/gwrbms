// Dev notes
//
// Background information on nomenclature and architecture decisions here.
//
// - Bootstrap functions, variables, and mixins are included for easy reuse.
//   Doing so gives us access to the same core utilities provided by Bootstrap.
//   For example, consistent media queries through those mixins.
//
// - Bootstrap's **docs variables** are prefixed with `$bd-`.
//   These custom colors avoid collision with the components Bootstrap provides.
//
// - Classes are prefixed with `.bd-`.
//   These classes indicate custom-built or modified components for the design
//   and layout of the Bootstrap docs. They are not included in our builds.
//
// Happy Bootstrapping!
