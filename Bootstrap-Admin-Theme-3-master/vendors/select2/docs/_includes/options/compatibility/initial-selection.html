    Old initial selections with <code>initSelection</code>

    <a class="alert-link" href="announcements-4.0.html#removed-initselection">Deprecated in Select2 4.0.</a>
    This has been replaced by another option and is only available in the
    <a class="alert-link" href="index.html#builds-full">full builds</a> of
    Select2.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the past, Select2 required an option called <code>initSelection</code>
    that was defined whenever a custom data source was being used, allowing
    for the initial selection for the component to be determined. This has
    been replaced by the <code>current</code> method on the
    <a href="#dataAdapter">data adapter</a>.
