    Localization, RTL and diacritics support
  </h1>

  <h2 id="language">Multiple languages</h2>

  <p>
    Select2 supports displaying the messages in different languages, as well
    as providing your own
    <a href="options.html#language">custom messages</a>
    that can be displayed.
  </p>

  <p>
    The language does not have to be defined when Select2 is being
    initialized, but instead can be defined in the <code>[lang]</code>
    attribute of any parent elements as <code>[lang="es"]</code>.
  </p>

  <div class="s2-example">
    <p>
      <select class="js-example-language js-states form-control">
      </select>
    </p>
  </div>

{% highlight js linenos %}
$(".js-example-language").select2({
  language: "es"
});
{% endhighlight %}

  <h2 id="rtl">RTL support</h2>

  <p>
    Select2 will work on RTL websites if the <code>dir</code> attribute is
    set on the <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> or any parents of it. You can also
    initialize Select2 with <code>dir: "rtl"</code> set.
  </p>

  <div class="s2-example">
    <p>
      <select class="js-example-rtl js-states form-control" dir="rtl"></select>
    </p>
  </div>

{% highlight js linenos %}
$(".js-example-rtl").select2({
  dir: "rtl"
});
{% endhighlight %}

  <h2 id="diacritics">Diacritics support</h2>

  <p>
    Select2's default matcher will ignore diacritics, making it easier for
    users to filter results in international selects. Type "aero" into the
    select below.
  </p>

  <div class="s2-example">
    <p>
      <select class="js-example-diacritics form-control">
        <option>Aeróbics</option>
        <option>Aeróbics en Agua</option>
        <option>Aerografía</option>
        <option>Aeromodelaje</option>
        <option>Águilas</option>
        <option>Ajedrez</option>
        <option>Ala Delta</option>
        <option>Álbumes de Música</option>
        <option>Alusivos</option>
        <option>Análisis de Escritura a Mano</option>
      </select>
    </p>
  </div>

{% highlight js linenos %}
$(".js-example-diacritics").select2();
{% endhighlight %}
